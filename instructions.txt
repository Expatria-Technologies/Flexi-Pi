# Build the kernel, rootfs and image

make commit board=bcm2711
make rootfs board=bcm2711
make image board=bcm2711

# Hint - ./build-lcnc.sh will run all of the above commands so you can leave it unattended but do sudo su first to keep root permisisons (run as root eg. sudo su)
# After the first run you generally just need to make the image as the kernel and rootfs won't change
# the kernel won't change unless Debian Bookworm advances the kernel version AND/OR there is a later PREEMPT_RT patch (using patch-6.1.46.patch released 17-Sep-2023)
