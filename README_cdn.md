## Flexi-Pi

Flexi-Pi is a custom configured LinuxCNC image for use with the [Flexi-HAL](https://github.com/Expatria-Technologies/Flexi-HAL) CNC controller and Remora firmware.The Flexi LinuxCNC components are pre-installed along with all of their dependencies, and reference configurations are included to get you started. **You will need to edit these configurations for your specific machine before attempting motion.** The base configuration runs QtDragon_hd as the default supported UI. 

Both the Raspberry Pi 5 and Raspberry Pi 4 are currently supported. Performance is significantly better with a Pi 5, however the Pi 4 image here performs better than the previous releases. 

**To get started:**
* Download the release for your specific Pi board (Pi 4 or Pi 5)
  https://github.com/Expatria-Technologies/Flexi-Pi/releases
* Extract the image archive
* Flash the image to an an 8GB or larger SD card using dd, balenaEtcher, or the tool of your choice. The filesystem will be automatically resized on first boot to fill the entirety of the SD card.
* Install the Pi onto the Flexi-HAL headers and insert the SD card into the Pi.
* Ensure the jumpers are set as shown in the Flexi-HAL Configuration section of this README
* Connect your display, keyboard, etc. to the Pi
* Connect power to the Pi/Flexi-HAL and boot the OS
* Read the contents of the README present on the desktop for instructions specific to the image used. This includes some hints on flashing your Flexi-HAL with the Remora firmware, and starting LinuxCNC.

The default username and password are both `expatria`.

A high-endurance SD card from a reputable manufacturer is recommended. The Sandisk U3 High Endurance cards have performed well in our testing. Select a card with a high read/write speed for the best performance. 


Also pre-installed in this image are the standard Remora-spi and Remora-eth-3.0 components. These are included on an as-is basis, but are updated with each image build. 

### Booting the Pi 5 from an NVMe Drive

If you wish to use an NVMe drive instead of an SD card, you will need to update the boot order in the Pi's EEPROM. You can do this from the Flexi-Pi image running on an SD card. To update the boot order in EEPROM:

* Flash the Flexi-Pi image to an SD card
* Insert the SD card into the Pi and boot
* **Ensure the Pi has a stable source of power for this operation.**
* Open a terminal and enter the command `sudo rpi-eeprom-config --edit`
* Change the 'BOOT_ORDER' line to 'BOOT_ORDER=0xf416' to boot from NVMe first, and fall back to SD if not present.
* Add 'PCIE_PROBE=1' to a new line below the 'BOOT_ORDER' line above
* Exit the editor/save the file. The EEPROM will then program automatically.

After editing your EEPROM config should contain:

```
[all]
BOOT_UART=1
POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=0
BOOT_ORDER=0xf416
PCIE_PROBE=1
```

You can then write the Flexi-Pi image to an NVMe drive using a USB NVMe Dock and your PC, or by downloading the image to the Pi while it is running from the SD card and writing it to your NVMe drive using `dd` or similar. 

We suggest avoiding NVMe hats that install on or otherwise interfere with the GPIO pins. The [Pimoroni NVMe Base](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/nvme-base) has been tested to work, and mounts to the underside of the Pi which works well with the Pi mounted on the Flexi-HAL.

## Flexi-HAL Configuration
Jumpers need to be in place in the marked locations on the Flexi-HAL for the Pi to communicate with the MCU for firmware flashing:

These are shipped in place by default from the Expatria shop, but if they have been moved or removed they will need to be replaced. 

To provide sufficient clearance for a cooler on a Pi 5, a 40-pin female header can be used as a riser between the Flexi-HAL and the Pi.
